    <p class="description para">These hand-held breakfast bundles are quick to make and fun to take when you're on the go. Set out a variety of filling ingredients and toppings and let everyone assemble their own.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup diced red potatoes</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
      <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>8 (7 inch) whole wheat tortillas</li>
      <li>1 pound cooked and crumbled turkey bacon</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 large avocado, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>½ cup salsa, or as needed</li>
      <li>½ cup reduced-fat sour cream, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt 1 1/2 teaspoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir potatoes in hot butter until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Melt remaining butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Beat eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Reduce heat under skillet to medium. Cook and stir eggs in hot skillet until set, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to a plate.</li>
      <li>Spread tortillas out onto a work surface. Spoon potatoes, onion, eggs, bacon, Cheddar cheese, avocado, salsa, and sour cream in a line across the middle of a tortilla. Fold opposing edges of each tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito.</li>
